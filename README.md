I have done the application with react using Hooks, 

with the use of libraries such as redux for the management of states at the application level to be able to save the list of favorite TvShows,
for the style the TailwindCSS library was used
create 4 components:
App: main component
TvShows: for
Search: search bar
Show: row of each Tv Show

For the modal use the react-modal package, for the memory storage use localStorage which is accessible from the reducer to validate if there is data
